# Horiseon Refactored Webpage

## Description

This project focused on refactoring the existing code for the Horiseon webpage so that it included semantic HTML and was more accessible. Some issues with the existing code included a non-functional link, lack of alt tags on the images, and unorganized CSS attributes. Although it was challenging at times, this was a good exercise in finding and fixing bugs.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Once the webpage is open, the links in the navigation bar will quickly lead the user to the corresponding section on the page with more information on that topic.

A helpful resource while working on this project is an article from W3 Schools. It explained semantic elements and how/when to use some of the most popular ones.
